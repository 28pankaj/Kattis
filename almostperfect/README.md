#Almost Perfect
A positive integer pp is called a perfect number if all the proper divisors of pp sum to pp exactly. Integer dd is a proper divisor of pp if 1≤d≤p−11≤d≤p−1 and pp is evenly divisible by dd. For example, the number 2828 is a perfect number, since its proper divisors (which are 11, 22, 44, 77 and 1414) add up to 2828.

Perfect numbers are rare; only 1010 of them are known. Perhaps the definition of perfection is a little too strict. Instead, we will consider numbers that we’ll call almost perfect. Positive integer pp is almost perfect if the proper divisors of pp sum to a value that differs from pp by no more than two.

###Input
Input consists of a sequence of up to 500500 integers, one per line. Each integer is in the range 22 to 109109 (inclusive). Input ends at end of file.

###Output
For each input value, output the same value and then one of the following: “perfect” (if the number is perfect), “almost perfect” (if it is almost perfect but not perfect), or “not perfect” (otherwise).
