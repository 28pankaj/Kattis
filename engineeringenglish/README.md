#Engineering English
Engineers have taken over the university’s English department! As part of their plan to dominate the university, they have employed you to write their nefarious software. Their goal is to eliminate all duplicated words from all texts in the English department, because, as they say, “duplicated words are duplicated work” and “duplicated work wastes money.” Actually, what they would really say is “duplicated words are . work” and “. . wastes money”. This is what your program should do – remove all duplicate words and replace them with a period.

###Input
Input is a textbook with at most 20000 words which should be processed. Punctuation does not appear (it has already been removed by another programmer); words are made up of up to 20 lower and uppercase characters (a-z). Case does not matter when comparing words for duplicates (i.e. ‘Book’ and ‘book’ and ‘bOoK’ should be considered the same word). Input ends at end of file.

###Output
Print each word the first time it appears, but thereafter if that word appears again print a period. Separate adjacent words using a single space.
