#Modulo
Given two integers AA and BB, AA modulo BB is the remainder when dividing AA by BB. For example, the numbers 77, 1414, 2727 and 3838 become 11, 22, 00 and 22, modulo 33. Write a program that accepts 1010 numbers as input and outputs the number of distinct numbers in the input, if the numbers are considered modulo 4242.

###Input
The input will contain 10 non-negative integers, each smaller than 10001000, one per line.

###Output
Output the number of distinct values when considered modulo 4242 on a single line.

Explanation of Sample Inputs
In sample input 11, the numbers modulo 4242 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,91,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 1010.

In sample input 22, all numbers modulo 4242 are 00.

In sample input 33, the numbers modulo 4242 are 39,40,41,0,1,2,40,41,039,40,41,0,1,2,40,41,0 and 11. There are 66 distinct numbers.
