The teacher has sent an e-mail to her students with the following task: “Write a programme that will determine and output the value of XX if given the statement:

X=numberpow11+numberpow22+…+numberpowNN
X=number1pow1+number2pow2+…+numberNpowN
and it holds that number1number1, number2number2 to numberNnumberN are integers, and pow1pow1, pow2pow2 to powNpowN are one-digit integers.” Unfortunately, when the teacher downloaded the task to her computer, the text formatting was lost so the task transformed into a sum of NN integers:

X=P1+P2+…+PN
X=P1+P2+…+PN
For example, without text formatting, the original task in the form of X=212+1253X=212+1253 became a task in the form of X=212+1253X=212+1253. Help the teacher by writing a programme that will, for given NN integers from P1P1 to PNPN determine and output the value of XX from the original task.

###Input
The first line of input contains the integer NN (1≤N≤101≤N≤10), the number of the addends from the task. Each of the following NN lines contains the integer PiPi (10≤Pi≤999910≤Pi≤9999, i=1…Ni=1…N) from the task.

###Output
The first and only line of output must contain the value of XX (X≤1000000000X≤1000000000) from the original task.
