# Simple Addition
Yup, yet another trivial problem. You just have to add two integers! Oh, not easy enough? Sure, let’s say that they’re positive as well. Now it should be trivial, right?

### Input
The input consists of two lines, each containing a positive integer less than 10^10000. Oh right…I forgot to mention that the integers can be quite large.

### Output
One line containing the sum of the two integers.
